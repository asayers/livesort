* If the output exceeds the height of the terminal, and the user scrolls back,
  things are pretty messed up.  This is bad and I'm not sure how to fix it.
* If the output exceeds the width of the terminal, we don't clear enough lines.
* We could at least try to detect a non-interactive output and just behave
  like regular `sort`.
* Currently we redraw the entire screen on every new line.  It should be
  possible to be much more efficient by simply moving the cursor to the
  correct location and inserting a line.
